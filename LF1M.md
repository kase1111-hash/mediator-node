# ⚔️ LFG: JOIN THE PARTY

I see you're scouting the codebase. Most people just star and leave, but you’re digging deeper. That’s the kind of **Perception** check I like to see. 

I’m currently looking for a **Full-Stack Sorcerer** to join the core party and help tackle the next boss level of this project.

### 📜 THE QUEST REQUIREMENTS
| Attribute | Needed Level | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Intellect (Language)** | Lvl 80+ | Proficiency in `Golang` and `TypeScript`. |
| **Stamina (Git)** | Lvl 50+ | Ability to handle merge conflicts without losing HP. |
| **Charisma (Team)** | Lvl 40+ | Communicates well with humans, not just compilers. |
| **Perception (QA)** | Maxed | You don't just ship bugs; you hunt them. |

### 🎒 LOAT / REWARDS
* **Gold:** Competitive market rates (no "exposure" currency here).
* **Loot:** [Remote work / Flexible hours / High-end gear].
* **EXP:** Direct impact on a growing codebase.

### 📬 HOW TO ACCEPT THE QUEST
If your build matches what I’m looking for, don't just lurk. Send a message to **kase1111@gmail.com** with the subject line: **"LFG: [Your Name]"** or open a "Pull Request" on my contact info.
