# Founding Contributor Pledge

**NatLangChain**

*Status: Canonical Commitment*

## Preamble

NatLangChain is not merely software. It is a protocol for preserving human intent, effort, and authority in systems increasingly mediated by machines.

By contributing to NatLangChain, I acknowledge that technical decisions here carry ethical weight beyond code quality or performance.

This pledge defines the commitments I voluntarily make as a founding contributor.

## I. Commitment to Human Sovereignty

I commit to upholding the principle that:

**LLMs may propose; humans must decide.**

I will not design, implement, or advocate for mechanisms that:

- Infer consent
- Automate agreement or settlement
- Substitute probabilistic inference for explicit human ratification

## II. Commitment to Explicit Authority

I commit to ensuring that:

- All authority is explicit, scoped, and traceable
- Delegation is bounded and revocable
- No contributor, agent, or system accumulates implicit power through convenience or inertia

I will treat unclear authority as invalid authority.

## III. Commitment to Legible Effort

I commit to building systems where:

- Effort can be shown, not merely claimed
- Evidence is append-only and time-stamped
- Failed paths and abandoned work are preserved, not hidden

I will resist incentives to optimize appearances over truth.

## IV. Commitment to Dispute Preservation

I commit to treating disputes as signals, not failures.

I will not:

- Auto-resolve conflicts for speed
- Suppress dissent for alignment optics
- Erase or rewrite contested history

I will ensure escalation paths remain explicit and human-governed.

## V. Commitment to Responsible Automation

I commit to automating only what:

- Expands human understanding
- Improves clarity, traceability, and fairness
- Preserves the human ability to contest meaning

I will refuse automation that collapses responsibility or obscures authorship.

## VI. Commitment to Capital Discipline

I commit to respecting the separation between:

- Meaning and money
- Effort and value
- Settlement and execution

I will not promote premature capitalization, automated value finality, or financialization of ambiguity.

## VII. Commitment to Memory and Accountability

I commit to preserving institutional memory.

I will:

- Favor traceability over convenience
- Accept that immutability includes my own mistakes
- Treat historical records as a shared responsibility

## VIII. Commitment to Refusal

I acknowledge that the strength of NatLangChain depends as much on what it refuses to do as on what it builds.

When pressured to cross these boundaries — for speed, scale, or profit — I commit to naming the refusal explicitly.

## Affirmation

By contributing to NatLangChain, I affirm:

> "I accept the responsibility that comes with building systems that mediate human agreement, effort, and value."

This pledge is not enforced by code. It is enforced by conscience, peer accountability, and historical record.
